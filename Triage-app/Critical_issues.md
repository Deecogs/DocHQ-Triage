Critical Issues Found:

1. Database Connection Issues

- backend/internal/db/models.go is empty - no database models defined
- backend/internal/db/connection.go - missing implementation for InitDB(), CloseDB(), PostgresVersion()
- backend/internal/db/repository.go - missing repository implementations

2. Missing Service Implementations

All service files in backend/internal/services/ appear to have incomplete implementations:

- Missing CreateAssessment() function used in handlers
- Missing GetAssessmentByID(), UpdateAssessmentStatus()
- Missing chat history and questionnaire handling

3. Security Vulnerabilities

Hardcoded Credentials:

- backend/migrations/000001_init_schema.up.sql:80 - Plain text password 'password123'
- APIs/api1_bpi.py:59 - Hardcoded project ID "dochq-staging"
- No password hashing in user creation

CORS Too Permissive:

- backend/cmd/app/main.go:49 - Allows credentials from any origin with wildcard

4. Frontend Issues

Memory Leaks:

- frontend/src/app.js:113 - recognition.onresult handler not properly cleaned up
- Missing cleanup for speech synthesis
- Audio context created but never closed

Race Conditions:

- app.js:194 - Chat history state updates not properly synchronized
- Assessment ID ref might be stale in callbacks

5. API Integration Problems

Python APIs:

- No error handling for missing credentials file
- api2_xai.py:121 - Triple-quoted string in system prompt might cause parsing issues
- Response format inconsistencies between API1 and API2

6. Missing Error Handling

Backend:

- No validation for assessment types beyond SQL constraints
- Missing nil checks for database queries
- No graceful degradation for external API failures

Frontend:

- No error boundaries for React components
- Network errors not properly displayed to users
- Missing timeout handling for long-running operations

7. Configuration Issues

- Frontend expects backend on localhost:8080 but Docker compose doesn't expose it correctly
- Missing health check endpoints
- No retry logic for failed API calls

8. Code Quality Issues

Unused Code:

- Commented out routes in backend/internal/api/routes.go
- AiChat component imported but not used in main app
- Dead code in app.js (lines 196-220)

Inconsistent Patterns:

- Mix of promise chains and async/await
- Inconsistent error response formats
- State management scattered (useState vs Recoil)

9. Deployment Problems

- docker-compose.yml:51 - Typo: "overridde" should be "overridden"
- No production builds configured
- Missing environment validation

10. Specific Bugs

Speech Recognition:

- app.js:125 - Recognition continues in infinite loop on error
- No handling for browser compatibility
- Listening state not properly reset on errors

Assessment Flow:

- Step progression logic can skip steps
- No validation that previous steps completed
- Dashboard can be accessed without completing assessment

11. Missing Features

- No authentication implementation despite login endpoint
- No session management
- No data persistence between page refreshes
- No progress saving for incomplete assessments

12. Performance Issues

- No pagination for chat history
- Frontend re-renders entire chat on each message
- No debouncing for rapid API calls
- Large base64 images sent in chat history

Recommendations:

1. Implement proper error boundaries and handling
2. Add authentication and session management
3. Fix database models and connections
4. Add input validation and sanitization
5. Implement proper state management
6. Add comprehensive logging
7. Fix security vulnerabilities
8. Add unit and integration tests
9. Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
10. Add monitoring and alerting
